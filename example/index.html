   * this example can be found here https://gist.github.com/romannurik/989438
   *
   * Helper method for running inline Web Workers, if the browser can support
   * them. If the browser doesn't support inline Web Workers, run the script
   * on the main thread, with this function body's scope, using eval. Browsers
   * must provide BlobBuilder, URL.createObjectURL, and Worker support to use
   * inline Web Workers. Most features such as importScripts() are not
   * currently supported, so this only works for basic workers.
   * @param {String} js The inline Web Worker Javascript code to run. This code
   *     must use 'self' and not 'this' as the global context variable.
   * @param {Object} params The parameters object to pass to the worker.
   *     Equivalent to calling Worker.postMessage(params);
   * @param {Function} callback The callback to run when the worker calls
   *     postMessage. Equivalent to adding a 'message' event listener on a
   *     Worker object and running callback(event.data);
